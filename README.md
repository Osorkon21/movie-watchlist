# Project-01: Movie Watchlist using TDMb Movie API

## Overview

* Using [TDMb's Movie API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs) we can browse and search for specific movies.

* Adding movie to Watchlist using `localStorage` and `JSON` methods to save retrieve data.



## Specific Goals (MVP)


Searched 

OpenWeatherMap API to get following weather data:
  
  city name 
  date 
  icon representation of weather conditions 
  temperature
  humidity
  wind speed

Selecting city from history will present current and future weather conditions 

```
